Databases are structured to facilitate the storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion of data in conjunction with various data-processing operations. A database management system (DBMS) extracts information from the database in response to queries.\n",
        "Simplified Text: The most common databases would store your toys in pieces. It might make sense, for example, to create a second box inside your toy box (database) to store all the heads of your dolls and another box to store arms. That type of database is called a relational database because it keeps track of which arms and heads go with (relate to) which dolls. But there’s a newer type of database which lets you keep your dolls in one piece. That kind of database is called a non-relational database.\n",

Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as \"training data\", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.\n",

But instead of using treats, machine learning uses data. You can't just tell a dog to do something, but if you give it treats when it does something, it will learn to do that. Machine learning algorithms are used in many applications, such as email filtering and computer vision.\n",

For example, if you had a thousand books and you wanted to find one that talked about dogs, it would be really hard for a human to find the right book. But if you gave the job to the right computer, it could search through all of the books in seconds.\n",

For example, electrons possess a quantum feature called spin, a type of intrinsic angular momentum. In the presence of a magnetic field, the electron may exist in two possible spin states, usually referred to as spin up and spin down. Each electron, until it is measured, will have a finite chance of being in either state. Only when measured is it observed to be in a specific spin state. In quantum experience the situation is more unsettling: material properties of things do not exist until they are measured. Until you look (measure the particular property), as it were, it has no fixed face up.\n",
        "Simplified Text: Quantum systems can exist in many states at the same time. Quantum experience is even more weird- it is like an apple that doesn’t have a color until you look at it. That’s because the apple has a lot of colors and it doesn't decide which one it likes until you look at it. The same thing is true for quantum objects- an electron can be in more than one place at the same time until you look at it. That is called quantum superposition.\n",
