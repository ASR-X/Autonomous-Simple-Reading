# Autonomous Simple Reading

## Description
The internet has a vast array of literature to learn and grow from. This content shouldnâ€™t be locked to only people that can understand it. Millions of people suffer from impaired learning disorder or simply have trouble understanding complicated text which oftentimes, can be simplified into much easier language while still retaining the essential information. 

## Next-gen NLP with GPT-3
Using OpenAI's third iteration of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), we have integrated truly capable NLP AI into text simplification. With a custom dataset of simplified summaries, Autonomous Simple Reading brings state-of-the-art natural language AI to help those with impaired learning.

## Easy to use interface
With Stream.io's chat interface, we bring a very familiar and easy to use interface for interacting with GPT-3. It is very similar to modern IM platforms such as Messenger and Slack, so you will feel right at home. Don't worry about temperatures or frequency penalty's, we've already tuned them for you.

## Try it out!
The prototype for Autonomous Simple Reading is publicly available at https://autonomous-simple-reading.webflow.io/ - give it a test!  
This GitHub repository is a mix of compiled react components in `./` and the exported Colab Python Notebook and Python source in `./backend/` 

## What's next for Autonomous Simple Reading  
- More interactive chatbot with different personalities
- Customised users that each have their own version of the AI that adapts to their individual needs
- OCR to simplify textbooks (Backend API already implemented)
- Text to speech for those who have trouble reading
- Chrome extension to simplify web pages inline
- Better analogies and simplifications
